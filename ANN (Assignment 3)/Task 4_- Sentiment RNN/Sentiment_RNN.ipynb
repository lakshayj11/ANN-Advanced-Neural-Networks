    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=400px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer. We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the word2vec lesson. You can actually train up an embedding with word2vec and use it here. But it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn the embedding table on it's own.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the embedding layer, the new representations will be passed to LSTM cells. These will add recurrent connections to the network so we can include information about the sequence of words in the data. Finally, the LSTM cells will go to a sigmoid output layer here. We're using the sigmoid because we're trying to predict if this text has positive or negative sentiment. The output layer will just be a single unit then, with a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the very last one, we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the cost from the output of the last step and the training label."

such as racism  the war on iraq  pressuring kids to succeed  technology  the elections  inflation  or worrying if they  ll be next to end up on the streets   br    br   but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home  the entertainment sets  a bathroom  pictures on the wall  a computer  and everything you once treasure to see what it  s like to be homeless  that is goddard bolt  s lesson   br    br   mel brooks  who directs  who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival  jeffery tambor  to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds  he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings  the bet  s on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can  t step off the sidewalk  he  s given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it  s written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly  lesley ann warren  an ex  dancer who got divorce before losing her home  and her pals sailor  howard morris  and fumes  teddy wilson  who are already used to the streets  they  re survivors  bolt isn  t  he  s not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it  s fight or flight  kill or be killed   br    br   while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn  t necessary to plot  i found  life stinks  to be one of mel brooks  observant films where prior to being a comedy  it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles  young frankenstein  or spaceballs for the matter  to show what it  s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don  t know what to do with their money  maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money   br    br   or maybe this film will inspire you to help others   ', 'airport    starts as a brand new luxury    plane is loaded up with valuable paintings  such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens  james stewart  who is flying them  a bunch of vip  s to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum  also on board is stevens daughter julie  kathleen

tile airport     this second sequel to the smash  hit disaster thriller airport       was directed by jerry jameson  while once again like it  s predecessors i can  t say airport    is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons  out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best  just  it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid  air hi  jacking  then the crashing  didn  t he see the oil rig    sinking of the     maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure         submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside  either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the    floods or if any of the doors are opened  it  s a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character  s  dull dialogue  lethargic set  pieces  a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity  while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for    odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks  there  s not as much urgency as i thought there should have been  even when the navy become involved things don  t pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships  helicopters flying about but there  s just something lacking here  george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes  barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background   br    br   the home video  theatrical version of airport    run    minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence  many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni  flashbacks to flesh out character  s  longer rescue scenes  the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator  while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport     as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions  interior design choices  i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren  t great either  along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award  s hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that  s a little harsh  the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately  the pace is slow  not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly   br    br   the production values are alright if nothing spectacular  the acting isn  t great  two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this  one time oscar winner james stewart looks old  frail  also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do  there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too   br    br   airport    is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far  i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly  the production  bland direction doesn  t help though  a film about a sunken plane just shouldn  t be this boring or lethargic  followed by the concorde    airport            ', 'brilliant over  acting by lesley ann warren  best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen  and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none  the corn on face is a classic  as good as anything in blazing saddles  the take on lawyers is also superb  after being accused of being a turncoat  selling out his boss  and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently  i  m a lawyer  he says  three funny words  jeffrey tambor  a favorite from the later larry sanders show  is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto  his character is more malevolent than usual  the hospital scene  and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site  are all  time classics  look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting  one bleeds   this movie gets better each time i see it  which is quite often    ', 'this film lacked something i couldn  t put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress  this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man  even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play  it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors  i just don  t know   br    br   but could it have been the screenplay  just exactly who was the chef in love with  he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant  and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits  than of anybody or anything else  he never convinced me he was in love with the princess   br    br   i was disappointed in this movie  but  don  t forget it was nominated for an oscar  so judge for yourself   ', 'this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon  sure  its flawed  it does not give a realistic view of homelessness  unlike  say  how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers  or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots   many of the jokes fall flat  but still  this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not  and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive  its not the fisher king  but its not crap  either  my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead  i love mel as a director and writer  not so much as a lead    ', 'sorry everyone    i know this is supposed to be an  art  film   but wow  they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch  although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent  this story is too painful to watch  the absence of a sound track was brutal  the loooonnnnng shots were too long  how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking  especially when the dialogue is two people complaining  i really had a hard time just getting through this film  the performances were excellent  but how much of that dark  sombre  uninspired  stuff can you take  the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene  otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman  and i  m no fan f his either  i think anyone who says they enjoyed     hours of this is   well  lying   ', 'this is not the typical mel brooks film  it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable  leslie ann warren made the movie  she is such a fantastic  under

or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them  it  s never about resolution  it  s only about interminable introspective babble  it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience  s ability to connect  woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out  and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining  i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past

allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman  but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for  ripping off  hitchcock in his suspense  horror films  in robin wood  s

is if you like the direction   but i thought i should simply establish once again that i  m basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant    for example not the sexual orientation of the director  or the alleged drug habits of the production team  lol    br    br   patrick stettner  s direction was moody and dark  and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so  sought  after feelings of  tension and release  rather than the messy  fast  paced camera  work and quick cuts we  re so often subjected to today  some people can truly show you a story through their

and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments  it  s not a bad movie exactly  but it  s one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on

screening it  ok  so i may exaggerate on the percentage  but you get my drift  besides stuff from hollywood  bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters  and from some of the trailers shown  i  m hyped to watch them too  tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for      but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas  when i watched jodha akbar  it was a full house  but it wasn  t for tashan   br    br   after watching it  i knew why  it was entertaining  but it was fundamentally weak  just like it  s literal english title  which means  style   tashan is all style  but little substance  not that it doesn  t have the usual star power  but scenes felt forced  and some bordered on a tad ridiculous  even for bollywood standards i must say  which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya  who wrote dhoom and dhoom   both of which i enjoyed tremendously   br    br   in his rookie directorial outing with tashan  while you can  t fault his direction  you  d probably scratch your head over the plot  which was clunky at best  it tried to force too many things into the story  though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation  but that came a little too late  and only toward the finale  which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie  with hong kong  s wirework and hollywood  s ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil  and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink  you have an assortment of vehicles appearing  and the one that took the cake  in a dhoom  homage  was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere   br    br   at best  tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy  and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters  saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff  a call center executive who gives english tuition  only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material  his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh  kareena kapoor   who  s not exactly who she seems  the meek and sweet natured hottie  she engages jimmy  s services for her boss  mobster bhaiyyaji  anil kapoor   who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah  beng does it  and to complete the quartet  akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey  an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji  s business   br    br   so begins a road trip of sorts  with friends who turned enemies  and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on  jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all  because he goes from zero to hero  executing moves that would shame rambo  in absolutely no time  which is quite out of character  kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men  and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes  and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee  every character has a backstory created  and i thought akshay kumar  s bachchan pandey was probably the best  the most touching and the most fun of the lot  even though his character seemed a lot like a non  green incredible hulk with his gravity  defying leaps and power packing punches  his wounds also heal automatically  which impressively puts wolverine to shame  and the best part is his theme song  which is damn alpha  male and played in ra  ra mode each time he takes on adversaries   br    br   but sad to say  that  s the only tune that is memorable  something that cheers  bachchan  pandey  bachchan  pandey   for most bollywood movies i watch  i will usually be able to  despite the obvious language gaps  emerge from screenings humming a tune or two  i wasn  t able to do that after tashan  because the songs unfortunately just weren  t catchy at all  usually the song  dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location  that i enjoy  versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain  or atop jagged rocks on the beach front   br    br   tashan probably didn  t take itself too seriously  but coming from vijay krishna acharya  s story  you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous  and for continuity to be a little more careful as well  billed as a blockbuster  now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one  despite akshay kumr stealing the show  tashan could have been better on the whole   ', 'after seeing several movies of villaronga  i had a pretty clear opinion about him   he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters  forgetting about a rhythm of the movie  that is why  though having good critics  his movies never caught the broad audience attention  in aro he follows the same line  but really improved on the rhythm  especially in the end of the movie  frankly speaking  i slept through the first part  cause though the first part gives necessary information  it is really slow  nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga   br    br   recommended   ', 'shame on yash raj films and aditya chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe

materialized and on the last scene i just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can  throw away  crores on such stupidity  shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to  saif ali khan  completely disappointed in your choice of film  kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and akshay comes up as the dim  wit  anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for english  his cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last   minutes  it was enough

fall for in aro tolbukhin  en la mente del asesino  inside the killer  s mind   that it  s very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning  let  s just say that this movie is like an

viceversa  which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering  did he really ever existed  the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala  worked in a religious mission and then killed some people  an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced  the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death  nowadays  some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character  the one we are witness of  the movie   br    br   for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aros mind  mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done  nevertheless  the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions  we clearly never justify them  so  the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into aro  s childhood  giving the movie such an incredible new force  even tough never got weak or boring    br    br   i don  t mean  and don  t want  to spoil anything

cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved  the most unwanted was the flashback sequence of akshay  s love story  after the faulty script the weakest point of the movie

detract from being entertained  mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line  the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster  the charismatic

such a magnitude together  there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love  stories as it is  filmmakers shouldn  t try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie    out of a possible     i give this film a mere      ', 'the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar  akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in     neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman  it is hilarious  except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film  the story looks like the writer told his   yr old son to write  the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director  except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan  i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody      is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero   ', 'when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was  this is the only movie i think i would ever give a   star rating  i am sure this movie will always be in my top    br    br   the acting is superb  leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best  i don  t think anyone could have a better job than kate   br    br   if it is a rainy day and you can  t decide what to rent  well  this is the one  you will love all the acting  special effects  and much much more   br    br   if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now    you won  t regret it   br    br    ', 'i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj film   br    br   jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss  lakhan singh  english  the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she can  t do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh  who is also known as bhaiyyaji  but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji  lakhan singh is a don  in the meantime  bhaiyyaji hires a man  bachchan pandey  to track down jimmy and pooja   br    br   starring saif ali khan  kareena kapoor  anil kapoor and akshaye kumar  the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopra   br    br    tashan  has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched  yes  the scenery is good and kareena kapoor  and her much publicised weight loss  looks good  but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other  hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production  with reference to songs  unfortunately  there is not one song that i can remember now   br    br   there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well  but this cannot be said for anil kapoor  it did not suit him at all as a villain  lastly  never mind aditya chopra  who in the past has produced and directed good films such as  mohabbatein   what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie   br    br   conclusion bad movie  not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression   ', 'why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather  titanic is the greatest movie of the   st century  with great acting  directing  effects  music and generally everything  this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn  t like it any more so most of the world decided to agree  there is nothing wrong with this movie  all i can say is that this movie  not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time  the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i  ve ever seen  apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time  the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton  these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron  s masterpiece titanic   ', 'i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted  so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that  it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom    and saif ali khan  s son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback    br    br   after watching it  i understood that why their wasn  t a proper trailer because there wasn  t anything in the film to show  the story was extremely dum and even a   year old child can come up with a better story  line  there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it  s difficult to figure out that who is killing who  also the action was daft  unrealistic e  g   man with a handgun managed to kill about    men with machine guns   br    br   while i was watching tashan it reminded me of  films  br    br   sin city during the opening credits   br    br   koyla anil kapoor  s terrible english like amrish puri in koyla   br    br   jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny   br    br   i also heard the budget is   crores which is the same amount as dhoom  and i don  t know where all the money went to  anyway if you did not like dhoom  then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan  race was hot on heels and that is a million times better   br    br   the only  good songs are dil haara  challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film  even anil kapoor  s terrible english couldn  t save this discomfiture   ', 'just two comments     seven years apart  hardly evidence of the film  s relentless pulling  power  as has been mentioned  the low  budget telemovie status of   gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal  having said that however the thing is not without merit  either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se   br    br   true  the plot at its most basic is a re  working of the amityville horror  only without much horror  more a case of intrigue  gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax  investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the  house  as the main suspect  the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard  it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments   br    br   having picked the dvd up for a mere      last week at my regular video store  i cannot begrudge the expenditure        would be an acceptable price for the film  just don  t expect fireworks   ', 'i don  t want to go too far into detail  because i can  t really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film  but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie  the animation is crud and the story alternates between boring  pointless to extremely irritating  the humor was completely lost on the audience  and yes  ghost in the shell fans  this is not an action sci  fi or anything like that  its an attempt at slapstick comedy  and the humor just did not work after being translated  it was a total chore to watch this movie  and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest  especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything  i wasn  t expecting a ghost in the shell sequel  but i was expecting something entertaining  and it simply didn  t achieve this  yaaawwnnn    rent kino  s journey instead   ', 'what  s inexplicable  firstly  the hatred towards this movie  it may not be the greatest movie of all time  but gimme a break  it got   oscars for a reason  it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason  it  s a damn good movie  which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it  i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters  i  ve rewatched it on tv and video  and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen  twice  or maybe three times  actually   but that might be it  the appeal of it  it  s a movie  yes  capital m there  it  s an epic  it  s a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur  now  ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me  with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama  not that titanic has none of that  well  the acting was actually very good  the melodrama was quite heavy  handed at times   br    br   but the reason titanic works is that it  s such an emotional ride  i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind  or give me a visual thrill  this movie isn  t exactly dumb  but it  s not cerebral at all  the visual thrills are simply means to an end  to fuel the emotions of the audience  i didn  t cry when bambi  s mom died  i don  t react to tearjerkers  but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million  an emotional rollercoaster that  if it were a regular one  would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl  and i  m sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it  and have a ready supply of cynicism  then you can thoroughly dislike this movie  but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit  if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt  you  ll enjoy it completely  and look at the top ten grossing films of all time  is a single one of them bad  is a single one of them worth a score of  out of    no  not even the phantom menace  and this movie made    billion dollars worldwide  it can  t be bad  not possible         br    br   p  s  how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman  spiderman was a fun movie  but it was a total     kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did  it simply wasn  t anything all that special  no one will remember it in   years  but i  m pretty sure titanic will be remembered   ', 'tashan  the title itself explains the nature of the movie   br    br   this type of movies are actually made for flop  what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c  grade movies  or even some c  grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan  the much hyped and over  confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box  office which it certainly deserved   br    br   in my view  this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films  banner  how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick  he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi  s ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last  the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences   br    br   the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences  hearts  in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions  i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay  but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif   s hand instead of akshay  just from the starting point i expected of it  but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth  saif is the main behind the whole adventure  while akshay joins in the midst  in any movie  the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit  and tashan loses in this way  and unexpectedly failed to become a hit   br    br   akshay  s has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies  he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again  in between saif did a great job in race  and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie  but he has fully developed himself in the acting field  and last but not the least about kareena  she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean  but i myself don  t think so  instead she became slim  yes slim    it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people  or say  male   beside them it is nice that saif  s son ibrahim appears in the beginning  last as young saif  i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career   br    br   those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood  or say want to be admitted in an asylum  thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films  in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of  years before going into practical directions   br    br   sorry  i don  t like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies   ', 'previously  i wrote that i loved  titanic   cried at its ending  many times over   and i  m a guy in his    s  i also wondered about why this great movie  which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics  was given only a    rating by imdb  com users   br    br   well  i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings  while      of all votes gave it a   rating       gave it a  rating  these      of these irrational imdb users  in effect  pulled the overall rating down to      br    br   in my previous comments  i blamed this very unusual voting pattern  a sudden surge in  ratings  with a high   rating  dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the  rating level  on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio  believe me  i  ve tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people  young men  mostly   who defame him left and right  they absolutely hate the man  and they will have no part in giving him any credit in  titanic    to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn  t like the movie that much  and gave it a  or a   etc  everyone has  and is entitled to  his  her own taste  but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only    overall for  titanic   pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous  ratings  is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture    br    br   let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of  titanic  to  randomly chosen box office and critical  bombs   there are many more  but these  will prove my point    heaven  s gate        was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing  and imdb voters  ratings were        ratings and      ratings  overall rating of       big top pee  wee        got       ratings and      ratings  overall rating of       cat people        got       ratings and      ratings  overall rating of       blind date        got       ratings and      ratings  overall rating of       jumpin  jack flash        got       ratings and      ratings  overall rating of      what do all of these films have in common with  titanic   all of the percentages of their  ratings are lower     than  titanic   and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award  again   titanic  got       ratings  compare that to the other  movies i just mentioned   br    br   can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor   br    br    ', 'i just saw the movie in theater  the movie has very few good points to talk about  kareena  s beauty and a couple of songs may be  thats it  the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas  anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed  even mumbai indians too  just now chennai has made it to semi  final    br    br   but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes  now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood  but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real  but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time  they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie  now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people  but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work  all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded  at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar  this is height of stupidity  audience is not paying to watch such stupidity  i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies  they cant make it  the last good action i have seen was from  ghatak  and  khiladiyon ka khialdi   the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me  does these people see their movie after completion  can  t they figure out that the slow motion action  which is done using ropes  is too unrealistic and childish  better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it  i just want to go back to amitabh  s era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes  the sound effect was not very effective in those days  but visually it is much better than current era scenes   br    br   this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors  please don  t make any more action movies  until you acquire the art of making it realistic   ', 'i loved this movie since i was  and i saw it on the opening day  it was so touching and beautiful  i strongly recommend seeing for all  it  s a movie to watch with your family by far   br    br   my mpaa rating pg    for thematic elements  prolonged scenes of disastor  nudity  sexuality and some language   ', 'the storyline was okay  akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie  kareena kapoor looked bad  there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner  i don  t know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role  there was nothing much to do for him in the movie  just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is  said ali khan was alright  i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot  what are we  fools     what do they think  they will show  men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them  is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals     they take an entire squad of     policemen and no one was there to surround the palace  the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action  akshay kumar was between a circle of      policemen all shooting at him      and he shooting back at them  none of the policemen  s bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen  crap  crap   br    br   i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement   br    br   i strongly recommend not to see this movie   ', 'the movie titanic makes it much more then just a  night to remember   it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten  why so criticised  i have no idea  could  will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it  could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece  it will be almost impossible   br    br   the director no doubt had the major impact on the film  a simple disaster film  boring to watch  converted to an unbelievable romance  yes i  m not the romance type either  but that should not bother you  because you will never see a romance like this  guaranteed  everything to the amazing effects  to the music  to the sublime acting   br    br   the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling  everything looks very real and live  the legend herself  titanic  is shown brilliantly in all classes  too looks  too accommodation  the acting was the real effect  dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles  no one could have done better  they are partly the reason why the film is so great   br    br   i guess it  s not too much to talk about  the plot is simple  the acting is brilliant  based on a true story  probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears  thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten  well if you haven  t seen this film your missing out on something hesterical  and a film to idolise for hollywood  could it get better  no  not at all  the most moving film of all time  don  t listen to people  see for yourself then you will understand  a landmark   don  t be surprised if you cry too   ', 'i was very displeased with this move  everything was terrible from the start  the comedy was unhumorous  the action overdone  the songs unmelodious  even the storyline was weightless  from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom  i had high expectations  the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all  of course  kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds  i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done  they tend to exaggerate way too much  in chinese films  this style works because that is their signature piece  but  hindi cinema  s signature are the songs  a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic  but  in the future  i  m sure these action movies will get much sharper  also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly  good luck next time   ', 'i had few problems with this film  and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated  true  it is over three hours long  but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly  i don  t think it is overrated at all  i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent  the film looks sumptuous  with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects  and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus  leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack  and kate winslet is lovely as rose  david warner  a great actor  steals every scene he  s in  the story is very rich in detail  and is hot on character development  obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be  though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow  the last hour is extremely riveting  and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat  when the titanic sank  i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving  the music score by james horner was lovely  though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on  the     miniseries was good  but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies  overall  i give titanic an        bethany cox   ', 'if there is one film which is the worst of this year  it  s tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom  style film  and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock  it was even worst then dhoom  and what i expected first saif  s introduction which is boring then saif  kareena meet  kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god  what he is doing in such a weird film  what kinda role it is  what acting is he doing  his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes  but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance  overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke  br    br   vijay krishna acharya would have got  films more to direct  if this film had worked  thats the strategy of yashraj  only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music  vishal shekhar  is ordinary  br    br   performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air  he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating  kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay  ', 'i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies  anyway  everyone remembers the rms titanic  it was big  fast  and  unsinkable     until april      it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever  well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship  well  onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film   br    br   so our two main characters are jack  leonardo dicaprio  and rose  kate winslet   they  re not annoying too much but watch this and you  ll find out why they could become annoying  http   tinyurl  com  ojhoyn   the main villain i guess is bad luck  fate  hand of god  no blasphemy intended   or just plain caledon hockley  billy zane   combine all of the above and what do you get   oh yes  we get a love story on a sinking boat  the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite  mr  andrews  victor garber   idk he was so nice   lovejoy  david warner   murdoch  ewan stewart   lightoller  jonathan phillips   captain smith  bernard hill   molly brown  kathy bates   and many more  we also got the present day treasure hunter  brock lovett  bill paxton   they add something to the story  something good  the action in here is awesome  especially in the second half  the drama as also good  in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears  the story is simple and it works  a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond  she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic  two lovers separated by social class and ultimately  the fate of the ship  everything about the story works and there are very few flaws  i give titanic  an    awesome  ', 'absolutely awful movie  utter waste of time   br    br   background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech  well if you really listen closely  whatever they speak is actually unintelligible   br    br   camera work is bad  editing is not present  background score gives a headache  action is shoddy  dialogs are unintelligible  acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler  now she looks like a starved wrestler  hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace   br    br   after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it  but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure   br    br   please if you want to torture yourself  go ahead watch this   ', 'titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill  fated voyage on the unsinkable ship  writer  director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april        claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic  the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet  they make for a good on  screen couple  dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable  they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well  the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane  kathy bates  frances fisher  jonathan hyde  and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film  the love story  the action  suspense  and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time  the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation  the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it  s few flaws  titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it  the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg  overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill  fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch   ', 'sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie    i had had a trauma after watching welcome       and thought that they wont do it again  but after loads of amazing promos  tashan finally ended as heart attack   br    br   such amazing  songs in promo  dil haara  chhaliya and tashan mein      and what u get in the movie  zero story  predictable plot  plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss        br    br   music  wise another major disaster    in the music album  they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these  jokers and they haven  t thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts     that song is such nice  quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album       if you plan to watch this movie  i would say  watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like     bachchan bachchan pandey      br    br   overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english   br    br   go away man  i need to puke   ', 'the ship may have sunk but the movie didn  t    director  james cameron

that was supposed to be the  comedy part  of the movie  just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish  it has a history of so many good films

br   when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic  i suppose my first reaction is  wait a minute  you don  t   i know so many people who don  t like this movie  and i  m not saying i don  t see why   the love story is too cheesy  well  yes but isn  t it enjoyable and moving  all right  the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic  everyone knows that love like this doesn  t actually exist  but this is a movie  doesn  t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while  the next complaint  dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors  well  ok  in this movie  i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials  however i think it  s unfair to say that they are terrible actors  i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in  but the roles they are given are simple  and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit  but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected   br    br   and finally  if one is going to complain that they don  t like this movie because they hate romance  or because they hate history  or tragic movies  then i  m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things  it  s like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies  simply for being a movie  not because you dislike the genre  this is a good movie   br    br   well deserving of its oscars  in particular  best cinematography  which i find to be the best i  ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy   br    br   i know some of the writing fails  such as the constant screaming of each other  s names throughout the movie  the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times  but overall it  s an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real  and the sinking feel so epic   br    br   i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie  but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea  such as it being a love story  rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed   br    br   i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic  including memoirs form the day it happened  and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults  the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper  not steel  and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it   br    br   i give this movie       not because i like romance movies  but simply because it  s an outstanding cinematic achievement  that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events   ', 'the film lacks style  i mean original style  everything looks copied including action  first appearances in the movie  songs  dialog delivery  etc etc  yes  there the goof  ups were original  like in the beginning a car is shown with number up number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number mh  that was one in many goof  ups of the movie   anything good in the movie  yes  for kareena fans  if there are any  kareena in bikini  for akshay fans  his dialogs and action stunts  thats it  nothing else  so watch it on your own risk and don  t blame the director or actors  director is already insane and actors  i pity them   ', 'titanic is a classic  i was really surprised that this movie didn  t have a solid ten  overall in the imdb user rankings  maybe  it  s just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays  but when it was first made it was really something  when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters  when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month  it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason  some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot  like the frozen baby  or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd  many people died on that ship  and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to  and let  s not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose  whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone  s imagination it was lovely  they barely knew each other  but they would die for each other  they trusted each other  they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money   i  ll never let go  jack   titanic is a great film down to it  s very core  it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting  excellent cinematography  beautiful music  and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers  it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie   ', 'this movie is horrible  the acting is a waste basket  no crying  no action  hopeless songs  though the scenery is great  i have always wanted to go to greece   br    br   anyway  as for saif  you  d expect a great performance  but even he let down the people   br    br   akshay kumar  recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs  he was sensational in this movie  for only this performance  filmfare should introduce another award  the toiletries award for the worst performance  by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat   br    br   kareena kapoor  she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma  in acting  in looks  or in body  she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her  she comes into this movie wearing bikini  s and tank tops and short shorts  i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife  to  be dress like that  but  she must  ve impressed some people dressing like that  and if you ask how  then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie  they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom  including me  personally i think that she dressed like a whore  but i really liked it   br    br   i am forced to give it a      but i  d really give this movie a      an unachieved film   ', 'another aussie masterpiece  this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural  and it does very well  it doesn  t resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks  it focuses more on emotional impact  a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney  co  bring to life  it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside  and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago  strange things begin to happen in the house  and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared  who was actually a mass murderer

black humor   br    br   good  with that point set  i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences  mamoru oshii is quite a good director  despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head  and even that was curious and somehow interesting  and i am surprised he came up with this  it may just be one of those lost  in  translation cases  i am afraid it is  but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible  the jokes seemed bad  the script was overcooked  i mean  give the audience a break  and shut up a little you damn narrator  to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast  paced speaking and absurd action   br    br   however  i thought the animation was really cool  the idea is great  and it is well exploited in those animated scenes  however  the eye  candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo  jumbo speech over still pictures  it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut  out hysterical characters scene   br    br   i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this  the idea was good but horribly exploited  maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie  or maybe it will be more and more over  narrated scenes  but hell  if you thought talking head was dense  amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke   br    br   of course  all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european  probably this is totally useless to japanese people  maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation  maybe   ', 'for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time  no exceptions  james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller  through films such as aliens  the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science  fiction goes  he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film  but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance  the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises  plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows  the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful  interesting and entertaining film about it  the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren  t given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose  gloria stuart  tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose  s and jack  s story alone  no one else  emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home  the music has become iconic and legendary  it is composer james horner  s finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience  the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is  only one problem  the usual james cameron problem  is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside  james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime  my heart won  t go on from this one   ', '    for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all cp must now be compared   br    br

time a tale about the ship of dreams  about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster  i don  t think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was  the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans     of them being teenage girls  i was   years old at the time  and of course saw the movie multiple times  it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful  at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong  of course i grew up and didn  t watch the film since i was    a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for     and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now  was it worth the hype  was it really the best movie of all time  was that leonardo  s real nose  ok  i know that  s silly to say  but i did re  watch the film  being completely honest here  titanic is a great movie  best movie of all time  no  just depends on your idea of a good movie  but titanic delivered in romance  humor  disaster  emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage   br    br   the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic  searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean  unsuccessful  they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude  wearing the heart of the ocean  dated the day the titanic sank      year  old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing  and contacts lovett

the necklace  rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic  revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater  in      the upper  class    year  old rose boards the ship with her fianc  cal hockley and her mother  ruth dewitt bukater  both of whom stress the importance of rose  s engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt  bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper  class  rose and her mother are financially broke  distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage  rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern  before she leaps  a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes  jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life  and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first  class formal dinner of the rapport  building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance  music and beer in third  class  but after cal  s servant informs him of rose  s whereabouts   rose is forbidden from seeing jack again  however  after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven  year  old daughter to behave like a  proper lady  at tea  rose defies him and her mother  asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean  an engagement present from cal  after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time  they go to the deck of the ship   br    br   they then witness the ship  s fatal collision with an iceberg  after overhearing the ship  s lookouts discussing how serious the collision is  rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal  meanwhile  cal

think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie  but it has great acting  amazing effects  a well  written story and still looks flawless  love it or hate it  you have to admit this movie didn  t get a lot of hype just because of leo  s baby face or kate  s amazing ability to cry on sight  this film is something special  it will always hold a special place in my heart  it has too seeing that i saw this film  times in the theater when it was released  but all that aside  i do recommend this movie  it  s a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day   br    br         ', 'the sight of kareena kapoor in a two  piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan  the mega  disappointing  mind  numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend  bad films are bad films and we see some every week  but tashan is not just a bad film  it  s a terrible film  terrible because it takes its audience for granted  terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they  ve got big movie stars onboard  written and directed by vijay krishna acharya  tashan is what you  d describe as a road movie  but one that  s going in all the wrong directions  saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff  a call  centre executive who  s hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji  that  s anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster  desperate to go cool  jimmy  s got his eye on pooja  the gangster  s pretty young assistant  played by kareena kapoor   who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of   crore rupees  determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja  bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job  so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey  the gangster  s faithful aide from kanpur  who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that  s hidden across the length and breadth of the country  much like those bad eighties potboilers  tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot  but the treatment  s so over  the  top  so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect  instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three  act structure  you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed  that garish item song in the desert  the bullet  dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort  kareeena  s bikini moment  even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks  a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala  and believe it or not  even a dhanno  style horse  driven tonga  in all fairness  not all these set pieces are badly done  the item song in the desert is quite neat actually  but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture  because you  re just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really  little do you expect in a seemingly fast  paced road movie  to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts  you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making  what  s more  i don  t think they cared either  the film reeks of arrogance  arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work  tashan is like an overcooked stew  there are films that kill you softly  and then there  s tashan  a film that kills you with excess  packaged snazzily with glossy  finish camera  work  exotic locations and fancy costumes  every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together  but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn  t hold  borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesn  t help either because they don  t blend with the film  s wafer  thin plot  one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging  but anil kapoor  s grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists  and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly  unable to find his feet  kareena kapoor  meanwhile  queen of over  the  top delivery  does a decent job  but of course  if tashan is salvaged to some extent  it  s thanks to akshay kumar  s irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character  you cringe when he  s cupping his crotch repeatedly  and you scowl when he delivers those double  meaning dialogues  but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he  s up there  despite some good music from vishal  shekhar  the songs seem like they  re only prolonging your misery  well that  s because tashan is a test of your patience  in

wreck by a group searching for treasures  that sunk with the titanic  which has recently occurred  one of the survivors of the titanic  rose dewitt bukater  who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search  she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic  with this  the scene shifts to southhampton  ireland where the titanic set sail from on april        as all the passengers are boarding  after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york  historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful  but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger  jack dawson  captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned  smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty  two years of experience to stretch the titanic  s legs out to full speed  the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs  but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie  on april        at       an iceberg was sighted  they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film  the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate  the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until     when the lights finally failed  the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic  s many pleas for help  the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own  the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship  overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too  the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking  also  the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold  which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle  overall  the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on

people on the ship  the core group of rose  jack  cal  and rose  s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time  yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer  thomas andrew the white star line representative  bruce ismay and all of the titanic  s officers were real  the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith  s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards  he had been a part of the white star line since     where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire  s captain when the titanic sunk  the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol  he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer  s former canadian hometown  as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower  class passengers from non  english speaking nations  in addition  officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted  the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss   not wanting to leave her husband  s side mrs  strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic  furthermore  mr  goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best  the richest man on the ship  john jacob astor  who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well  but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat  in addition  molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water  her ticket on the titanic had cost over four  thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke  all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware  the gymnasium  which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs  the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re  creation of the post  victorian era of      the rich at this time practically ruled everything  as the women  s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet  women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do  the rich did not take well to new money  such as molly brown as depicted  everything of the time was very formal  women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes  smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes  which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie  men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes  women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society  although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross  referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken  the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking   br    br   a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise  the director  james cameron  shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people  s lives  everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night  in addition  this film is a reflection of the      s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic  only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored  this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed  however  the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed  there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed  as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter   br    br   technically the film is very well done  to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie  in addition  a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean  cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the   years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship  furthermore  throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage  this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner  at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film   br    br   titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art  a true epic  like most history novels  we know the ending  but it doesn  t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture  certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming  sound  cintematography  and editing  if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early      s and how they face disaster  then this movie definitely is for you   br    br    ', 'this is the biggest flop of      i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster  the songs have been added without situations  the story have been stretched to fill the  hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it  s like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with    people  only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish    akki is also done a good job     but the movieee just forget it   ']\n"
